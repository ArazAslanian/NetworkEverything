Hello,

Response for Creating Connected Products:

We do not find web pages that take a while to load odd. We are used to the loading time. However, when an IOT device lags, we find it difficult because it can give a feeling like the world is broken or incoherent. This, in addition to several other reasons, are why it is far more challengning to create IOT devices than simple web apps.

Not so long ago, you could only go on the internet through your personal computer. Today, not only do phones and tablets have access to the internet, but also watches, security systems, and almost anything you could think of could have a version that has the ability to connect to the internet. IOT devices have become this new extension of the internet.

The idea that I could turn on all the lights in the house, start my coffee machine, or find out who is at home just by navigating several apps on my phone sounds freakishly cool. However it also makes me feel uncomfortable. It feels like technology is being used for something completely unneccessary. Why do I have to start my coffee machine while I'm still in bed? Is it so hard to get up and start it on my own? Who cares if it takes me two more minutes.

I find other things more useful: finding out who is home and activiating the heating system accordingly / calling the cops if there is movement detected while no one is supposed to be home sounds really cool. However, I also worry about privacy issues.



Idea for IOT device: Keeping track of groceries with a camera and a mobile app
-You can insert a camera in your kitchen that will scan food items and keep track of what is left.
-It will accordingly create shopping lists and can even order it online and have it delivered to your door.
-At first, you need to set up the inventory, but it shouldn't take long (about two hours to install the whole thing).
-If the food product does not have a barcode, you can take a picture of it with your phone and name it. From now on, when the camera sees that food product, it'll recognize it.
-The app can even suggest what food you could make with what you have
-Interusability: differnt family members could have different abilities. For example, some parents would not want to give their children the ability to order food, but they can still participate in the fun process of logging food.
-This app could also help with staying healthy, by ordering healthy ingredients, suggesting recipes with such ingredients, and setting alert systems when someone consumes a lot of sugar / candy.
-You can even make this personalized and have different accounts that can keep track of who consumed what for health-related reasons
-Also, if a family member cooks a meal, the app can calculate how many calories are in the meal, and other users have the option to log this meal into their list too
