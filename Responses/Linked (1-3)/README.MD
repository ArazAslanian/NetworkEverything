It’s a small world, and the internet has made it even smaller. It is often the case that
people would adopt the principles of reductionism, but looking at the fundamentals parts
that make a whole might lead people to fail at looking at the big picture.

Let’s take the example about research in medicine that is mentioned in the book. Often,
medical research disregards the complex interconnectedness of living matter by trying
to cure a disease focusing on a single molecule or gene. For example, some new drug
could be developed that treats a certain disease; but the side-effects of this drug disrupt
three other things in the body. Therefore, things should be studies as a whole, but with
limited technology, resources, and time to study matters holistically, can we blame
scientists that adopted the reductionist approach?

It was fascinating to read about social networks. As a psychology major at NYUAD, we
often study how people interact with themselves / a small group of people. We have not
yet looked at the big picture of how large groups of people are connected to each other.
This highly dense web makes it possible for billions of people to have short paths
leading to each other. It reminded me of a game my friends used to play on Wikipedia.
The objective of the game was for multiple players to start on the same page with a goal
of reaching a page about a particular topic by clicking on different hyperlinks that will
likely lead them to their end goal. The winner was the quickest player who got from
page x to y with the least amount of links.
