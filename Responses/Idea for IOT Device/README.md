Idea for IOT device: Keeping track of groceries with a camera and a mobile app:

- You can insert a camera in your kitchen that will scan food items and keep track of what is left.
- It will accordingly create shopping lists and can even order it online and have it delivered to your door.
- At first, you need to set up the inventory, but it shouldn't take long (about two hours to install the whole thing).
- If the food product does not have a barcode, you can take a picture of it with your phone and name it. From now on, when the camera sees that food product, it'll recognize it.
- The app can even suggest what food you could make with what you have
- Interusability: differnt family members could have different abilities. For example, some parents would not want to give their children the ability to order food, but they can still participate in the fun process of logging food.
- This app could also help with staying healthy, by ordering healthy ingredients, suggesting recipes with such ingredients, and setting alert systems when someone consumes a lot of sugar / candy.
- You can even make this personalized and have different accounts that can keep track of who consumed what for health-related reasons
- Also, if a family member cooks a meal, the app can calculate how many calories are in the meal, and other users have the option to log this meal into their list too
